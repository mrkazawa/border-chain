# Benchmarking #

The purpose of this document is to guide how to perform benchmarking for this project.

## Scenarios ##

We have several benchmarking scenarios.

1. Measure the capability of the cryptographic libraries used in this project. More details are available [here]().
2. Benchmark the client side of our access control scheme. More details are available [here]().
3. Stress test our authentication and authorization servers. More details are available [here]().

**Note**: We will use the VM to measure the benchmark specificed in the [Vagrant file]().
All of the instructions here are assuming to use the same VM configuration.
Furthermore, our code can also be run directly without VM.
However, you need adjust your prompt yourself as it may show different prompt as the one in this example.
